# Kavivanar

Kavivanar is a unique handwriting font, which is little thick and subtly slanted that mimic the Tamil handwriting as inclined text settings are more popular in Tamil typography. And also, the letterforms consist of calligraphic pen stress to keep the liveliness while providing a texture for body text. This font works very well with body text, and display type while providing an intriguing rhythm for the text settings.
